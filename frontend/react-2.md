### React

1. State vairables : something or some variable that react needs to constanly watch - that if this changes, DOM needs to update.

2. Why do we need React? For dynamic websites, these libraries make it easier for DOM manipulation

3. React is just an easir way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS. It's a new sytnax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS

React -> npm run build -> HTML/CSS/ JS

4. There were libraries that came into picture to write DOM manipulation like JQuery.

5. Three things which are the most necessary to understand React:

- State
- Components
- Re rendering

6. Any website can be divided into two parts:

- State and Components

7. State : An object that represents the current state of the app. It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change), for example, the value of the counter

8. Component: How a DOM element should render given a state, it is a reusable dynamic html snippet that changes given the state.

9. Re-rendering: A state chnage triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes.

10. Anytime a parent re-renders its child components re-renders as well.
