## Zustand

1.  Zustand is simple state management library, with very less boilerplate code as compared to Redux or Recoil.

2.  Follow follows Flux rule: State is changed only by a central, controlled place.

```
There is one store.
State can change only through defined actions.
Every change flows in one direction and triggers a UI update.
```

3. You write your global state in a store using create from zustand

4. then you can use this store as a hook in your components and that is it.
